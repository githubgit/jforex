 * When strategy loader sees this annotation for strategy class it asks user if he wants to allow the strategy full access.
 * If such acceptance receives strategy classes, they are loaded with full access policy allowing to read/write any files, use sockets etc.
 * Always try to avoid  using this annotation, if only need to read/write to file - you have full access to 
 * "~/My Documents/My Strategies/files" folder. In this folder you can read or write any file without requesting the full access.
